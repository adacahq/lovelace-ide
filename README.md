# Lovelace IDE - VS Code Fork with Claude Integration

This is a fork of Visual Studio Code that integrates Claude AI capabilities directly into the IDE.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (>=20.x)
- npm
- Git

### Building from Source

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/lovelace-ide.git
   cd lovelace-ide
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Build the application**:
   ```bash
   npm run compile
   ```

### Setting up the `lovelace` CLI Command

#### For Development (Building from Source)

If you built from source, you can set up the `lovelace` command to launch the IDE:

**macOS/Linux**:
1. **Create the launch script**:
   ```bash
   # Replace /path/to/lovelace-ide with your actual project path
   mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
   cat > ~/.local/bin/lovelace << 'EOF'
   #!/bin/bash
   exec "/path/to/lovelace-ide/scripts/code.sh" "$@"
   EOF
   chmod +x ~/.local/bin/lovelace
   ```

2. **Add to PATH** (add to your shell profile: `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.):
   ```bash
   export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
   ```

3. **Reload your shell** and test:
   ```bash
   source ~/.zshrc  # or ~/.bashrc
   lovelace --version
   ```

#### For Production Install (macOS Applications Folder)

If you have the compiled `Lovelace.app` installed in your Applications folder:

1. **Create the CLI script**:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
   cat > ~/.local/bin/lovelace << 'EOF'
   #!/bin/bash
   # Launch Lovelace from Applications folder
   if [ -d "/Applications/Lovelace.app" ]; then
       exec "/Applications/Lovelace.app/Contents/Resources/app/bin/lovelace" "$@"
   else
       echo "Error: Lovelace.app not found in /Applications/"
       echo "Please install Lovelace in your Applications folder first."
       exit 1
   fi
   EOF
   chmod +x ~/.local/bin/lovelace
   ```

2. **Add to PATH** (if not already done):
   ```bash
   echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
   source ~/.zshrc
   ```

3. **Test the command**:
   ```bash
   lovelace --version
   ```

**Alternative: Direct symlink approach**:
```bash
# Create a symlink directly to the CLI binary in the app bundle
sudo ln -sf "/Applications/Lovelace.app/Contents/Resources/app/bin/lovelace" /usr/local/bin/lovelace
```

#### Windows

1. **Create a batch file** in a directory that's in your PATH (e.g., `C:\Windows\System32`):
   ```batch
   @echo off
   "C:\path\to\lovelace-ide\scripts\code.bat" %*
   ```
   Save as `lovelace.bat`

### Usage

Once set up, you can use the `lovelace` command just like the regular VS Code `code` command:

```bash
# Open current directory
lovelace .

# Open a specific file
lovelace myfile.js

# Open with specific arguments
lovelace --new-window /path/to/project
```

## Claude Integration Setup

To use the Claude integration features, you need to provide your Anthropic API key. The system will look for the API key in the following order:

### 1. Environment Variable (Recommended)

Set the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable before launching the IDE:

```bash
# On macOS/Linux:
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"

# On Windows (Command Prompt):
set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-api-key-here

# On Windows (PowerShell):
$env:ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

Then launch the IDE normally.

### 2. Browser Local Storage (Web Version)

For the web version, the API key can be stored in the browser's localStorage.

### Getting an API Key

You can obtain an Anthropic API key by:
1. Creating an account at [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com)
2. Navigating to API Keys section
3. Creating a new API key

## Claude Agent Features

The Claude integration supports two modes:

### Chat Mode
- General conversation and code assistance
- No file modifications

### Agent Mode  
- Integrated with the Phantom service for safe file operations
- Can analyze, refactor, and modify code
- Supports operations like:
  - Code refactoring and cleanup
  - Renaming symbols across files
  - Extracting functions/components
  - Performance optimization
  - Bug fixes
  - Code migration

File changes in agent mode are handled through the Phantom service, which provides safe, reversible modifications.

## Activity Bar Position

By default, the Activity Bar is now positioned at the **top** of the window. You can change this in settings:
- Go to Settings (Cmd/Ctrl + ,)
- Search for "activity bar location"
- Choose between: Top (default), Left, Bottom, or Hidden

## Related Projects

Many of the core components and extensions to VS Code live in their own repositories on GitHub. For example, the [node debug adapter](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-node-debug) and the [mono debug adapter](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-mono-debug) repositories are separate from each other. For a complete list, please visit the [Related Projects](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/Related-Projects) page on our [wiki](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki).

## Bundled Extensions

VS Code includes a set of built-in extensions located in the [extensions](extensions) folder, including grammars and snippets for many languages. Extensions that provide rich language support (code completion, Go to Definition) for a language have the suffix `language-features`. For example, the `json` extension provides coloring for `JSON` and the `json-language-features` extension provides rich language support for `JSON`.

## Development Container

This repository includes a Visual Studio Code Dev Containers / GitHub Codespaces development container.

* For [Dev Containers](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/download/containers), use the **Dev Containers: Clone Repository in Container Volume...** command which creates a Docker volume for better disk I/O on macOS and Windows.
  * If you already have VS Code and Docker installed, you can also click [here](https://vscode.dev/redirect?url=vscode://ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers/cloneInVolume?url=https://github.com/microsoft/vscode) to get started. This will cause VS Code to automatically install the Dev Containers extension if needed, clone the source code into a container volume, and spin up a dev container for use.

* For Codespaces, install the [GitHub Codespaces](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.codespaces) extension in VS Code, and use the **Codespaces: Create New Codespace** command.

Docker / the Codespace should have at least **4 Cores and 6 GB of RAM (8 GB recommended)** to run full build. See the [development container README](.devcontainer/README.md) for more information.

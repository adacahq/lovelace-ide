# Summary of Changes

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive file change tracking and diff visualization system that integrates lovelace-ai and lovelace-diffs extensions.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Changed Files UI Component
- Added a collapsible "Changed Files" section above the mode selector
- Shows modified, added, and deleted files with line count statistics
- Includes batch accept/reject buttons for all changes
- Only displays when there are actual changes (hides when empty)

### 2. Real-time Change Detection
- Automatically detects file changes after each Claude response in agent mode
- Calculates accurate line-by-line diff statistics (additions/deletions)
- Counts total lines for newly added files
- Filters out unchanged files from the change set

### 3. Inline Diff Decorations
- Shows old content with red background and new content with green background
- Displays deleted lines above their original position
- Handles modifications by showing both old and new versions
- Supports multiple sandboxes editing the same file

### 4. CodeLens Integration
- Accept/Reject buttons appear next to each block of changes
- No longer shows buttons at the top of the file
- Displays session information when multiple sandboxes modify the same file
- Groups consecutive changes into logical blocks

### 5. Architecture Improvements
- One sandbox per chat tab, created automatically on tab creation
- Sandboxes persist for the duration of the chat session
- Removed the ProposedChangeView popup interruption
- Direct file opening with diffs when clicking files in Changed Files list

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified

#### lovelace-ai Extension
- `src/views/chatViewProviderSDK.ts`: Added change detection, sandbox management, and webview messaging
- `media/chat.js`: Removed text animation, added changed files UI handling
- `media/chat.css`: Added styles for the changed files component

#### lovelace-diffs Extension
- `src/providers/sandboxDiffDecorationProvider.ts`: Implemented GitHub-style diff decorations
- `src/providers/diffActionCodeLensProvider.ts`: Enhanced to show buttons next to change blocks
- `src/services/changeDetectionService.ts`: Fixed to skip unchanged files
- `src/extension.ts`: Added new commands and updated initialization

### Key Fixes
1. Fixed missing codicons by adding proper localResourceRoots
2. Fixed button layout issues with proper CSS flex properties
3. Fixed sandbox creation hanging by implementing createSandbox command
4. Fixed TypeScript compilation errors with explicit array typing
5. Fixed line number accuracy in diff display
6. Fixed file filtering to only show actually changed files
7. Implemented accurate line count calculations for all change types

## Usage
1. Start a chat session - a sandbox is automatically created
2. Use Agent Mode to have Claude make code changes
3. After Claude responds, the Changed Files section appears
4. Click any file to see inline diffs with old (red) and new (green) content
5. Use Accept/Reject buttons next to each change block or use batch actions

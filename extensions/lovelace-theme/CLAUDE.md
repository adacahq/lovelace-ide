TASK:

You are expected to create new themes from those already listed here (which should act as inspiration). The colors of the theme are as follows:

* Primary: #6E42FD
* Secondary: #111111, #A62DF2, #480FFD, #2db7f2

You should create both light and dark modes. Note that the current themes should be renamed to Adaca (in place of Lovelace), e.g. Adaca Dark, Adaca Light, etc, but note there should be equivalent themes for Lovelace for each of the names you see currently. In other words, all existing themes should be renamed to Adaca equivalent, and then new themes created for Lovelace for each of the names that currently exists in package.json.
